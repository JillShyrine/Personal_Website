            <p> Greetings! I am Jill Shyrine J. Alejandrino, and I believe that coffee and coding are partners for life.
                I’ve always wanted to be an IT Professional ever since I was a kid, hence I’m here taking this path. 
                As a child, I've always been amaze of technology, until now I still am, that explains why my hobby includes
                making random programs and designing websites.<br><br> I know my journey is far from over, there’s alot more 
                challenges and obstacles waiting for me ahead, but I’m not scared for I know God is there to guide me,
                <br><br> I don't have much experience yet in the IT field compared to my peers, I've only joined a couple of 
                contest and events. I wanted to learn and explore more before I fully commit myself.<br><br>
                There's not much to know about me, however, I want to share my grandparents wisdom that had kept me going despite 
                all the failures. Never stop believing, if you believe then you can achieve! Padayon!</p>
